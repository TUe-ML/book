    "You probably know from your highschool math classes that every local minimizer $x_0$ of a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a stationary point: $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0)=0$. This is known as the first order neccessary condition. This property is easily understood, considering that the derivative indicates the slope of a function at a specified point. If we have a real-valued minimizer, then the slope is zero at that minimizer. If the slope would be positive, then we can go to the left to decrease the function value further, and if the slope is negative, we can go to the right. By means of this property, we can identify all the candidates that could be minimizers. Maximizers and saddle points are stationary points too. With the second order neccessary condition, we can filter further the minimizers from the pool of candidates. The second order neccessary condition states that at a minimizer the second derivative is nonnegative $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0)\\geq 0$. The second derivative is the slope of the slope. If we have a minimizer, then the slope increases: first we go down, and then we go up. Hence, we need that the slope of the slope does at least not decrease. \n",

    "Let's have a look at a seemingly simple example. The function $f(x) = \\frac14x^4 + \\frac13x^3 -x^2$ is plotted below and we see that there are two minimizers $x_1=-2$ and $x_2=1$. The question is just if those are all minimizers, or if there is another one beyond the scope of what is plotted here.\n",

    "The principles of the first and second order conditions can be generalized to functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^d\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ mapping from a $d$-dimensional vector space to real values. The main difficulty is that we have now more to consider than just left and right when looking for a direction into which we could minimize the function further. In fact, any vector $\\vvec{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ could indicate a possible direction in which the function might decrease. Luckily, we can show that we just have to check one direction, given by the negative *gradient*, which points into the direction of steepest descent. The gradient indicates the slope of a function in the directions of the coordinates, which are called the *partial derivatives*. A partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f(\\vvec{x})}{\\partial x_i}$ is computed like a one-dimensional derivative by treating all variables except for $x_i$ as  a constant. The gradient gathers those partial derivatives in a vector. The transposed of the gradient is called the *Jacobian*.\n",
