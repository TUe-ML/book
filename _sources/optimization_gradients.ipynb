    "## Matrix Derivatives\n",
    "In principle, we can compute matrix derivatives using partial derivatives and familiar rules like the chain rule. However, this process can be tedious and complex. Fortunately, most of the rules you know for one-dimensional derivatives also apply to higher-order derivatives. However, unlike in one-dimensional calculus, the order of multiplication matters for matrix derivatives because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative.\n",

    "Weâ€™ll start by examining the dimensionalities involved in matrix derivatives. For a function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that maps matrices to real values, we can define its derivative in two ways: as the gradient or the Jacobian.\n",

    "Be aware that the notation above is not used by all authors. Some authors define the Jacobian as we define the gradient here. To remember what is what, consider the gradient descent update rule, where we subtract the scaled gradient from the iterates. For functions mapping to real values (such as loss or objective functions), the gradient must have the same dimensionality as the function's arguments; otherwise, subtraction would not be possible.      \n",
