    "# The Sparse Regression Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We already discussed that there are infinitely many regression solvers $\\beta$ if $p>n$. Usually, we can avoid this situation by choosing a simple basis function class, for example affine functions. However, for various types of datasets it's quite common that there are more features than observations. For example in gene expression analysis, collecting patient data (observations) is costly, while the number of features (the genes) is big. Such datasets usually indicate for each observation (patient) the expression levels of their genes. The patients might have a specified disease, and the task if to find out why some patients live longer with this disease than others. The target would then be something like the survival time after a diagnosis has been made.\n",

    "Adding the seemingly simple sparsity constraint $\\lVert\\beta\\rVert_0\\leq s$ makes the resulting regression task unfortunately computationally much more difficult. An issue is that the sparse regression objective is not convex, because the feasible set $\\{\\beta\\mid \\lVert\\bm{\\beta}\\rVert_0\\leq s\\}$ is not convex. But it's even worse than that, because the $L_0$-'norm' is not a continuous function. The property of the constraining function is relevant, since the optimizers subject to constraints rely on integrating the constraints into the objective function, as seen in the dual formulation. Noncontinuous objective functions are bad for all the optimizers that we know, since they all rely on gradient information, which in turn relies on the assumption that a sufficiently small change in a data point has a small effect on the function value. Noncontinuous functions can differ vastly from one point to an infinitesimal small change from that point. That makes the local information about the directions in which the objective increases and decreases useless, and this means in turn that we are closer to a combinatorial optimization problem, where we just have to try various parameter constellations (e.g., various selections of features).   \n",

    "If $p\\in (0,1)$, then we can compute the value defined above, but it's not a real norm. For $p=0$ we can't compute the value above directly, because we would have to divide by zero. The $L_0$-'norm' is given by computing the formula above for $p=0$ without the root term. That is, we have $\\lim_{p\\rightarrow 0}\\lVert\\mathbf{x}\\rVert_p^p=\\lVert \\mathbf{x}\\rVert_0$. For optimization purposes this is good enough, since it means that we can relax the constraint $\\lVert \\mathbf{x}\\rVert_0\\leq s$ with the constraint $\\lVert \\mathbf{x}\\rVert_p^p \\leq s$ for a small $p\\approx 0$, or equivalently $\\lVert \\mathbf{x}\\rVert_p \\leq s^{1/p}$.     \n",

    "On the left we observe that the $L_0$-ball, containing the axes except for the point zero, progresses to a star shape for $p=0.5$ and further to a diamond for $p=1$, a circle for the Euclidean norm $(p=2)$, and a rectangle for the infinity norm. The $L_0$-ball is more suitably approximated for small values of $p$, but those $L_p$-balls are not convex, resulting again in a nonconvex objective. We see this for the $p=0.5$-ball: the line connecting the points $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ is outside of the ball. So, a popular choice is to relax the $L_0$-norm with the $L_1$-norm, that is closest to the $L_0$-norm with a convex unit ball.\n",

    "We see that the $L_0$-norm is rather nasty to optimize, because it has a point of discontinuity at zero (see also the plot below), where it is also not differentiable (continuity follows from differentiability). The $L_1$-norm is at least contiuous everywhere, but it has a point of nondifferentiability at zero. Finally, the squared $L_2$-norm is continuous and differentiable everywhere. Note, that we use the squared $L_2$ norm because the $L_2$-norm itself is also not differentiable at zero (for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\lVert x\\rVert = \\lvert x\\rvert$). Hence, the $L_2$-norm is squared (as it is also done for the RSS), since squaring a function in an objective doesn't change the set of minimizers.     \n",
