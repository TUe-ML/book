    "## Convex Optimization\n",
    "Convex optimization represents a somewhat ideal scenario in optimization problems. With a convex objective, there is only one minimum to find, simplifying the task. Many optimization problems in machine learning are convex, or at least convex in certain coordinates when others are fixed. Knowing whether an objective is convex is valuable for understanding how to improve a model. If a model derived from minimizing the objective function performs poorly on other metrics, this may indicate that the objective does not fully capture what defines a good model. To establish convex optimization objectives, we first define convex sets and convex functions.\n",
