    "# Regression Functions\n",

    "The possibilities to select a class of functions that are suited to model a given regression task are numerous. Typical function choices are exponential, logarithmic, polynomial functions or any composition of those. How can we make a machine learn which function would be best when we have so many choices?\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick which is used in regression is to learn a linear combiation of predefined functions. For example, if we are unsure if the feature-target relation is exponential or logarithmic, then we can define our regression function as a weighted sum of exponential and logarithmic functions:\n",

    "This formalization allows us to learn a function $f$ by means of the parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$. Those parameters can then be optimized after we define a loss function for the regression task. The functions which we use to compose our function $f$ (here $\\log(x)$ and $\\exp(x)$) are called **basis functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  main insight (which we will discuss in the following for various basis functions) is that nonlinear functions such as $f(x)$ in Eq. {eq}`eq_regression_f` can be represented as linear functions in a _transformed feature space_.
