The second pattern is $(1,1,5,5)$,  indicating that the first two movies are not liked  and the last two are liked. The last user likes all movies, which could be understood like he belongs to  both patterns. In fact, we can write the matrix $D$ as the following rank-2 MF:\n",

    "    We  see that the decomposition of SVD is quite different  from the one in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:patternDecomp}. The first pattern $V_{\\cdot 1}$ indicates more general information of the data, like movie popularity. Since there are more users who like movies 1 and 2 than users who like movies 3 and 4, movies 1 and 2 get a slightly higher score of 0.6 (vs. 0.4) in the first pattern $V_{\\cdot 1}$. The second pattern $V_{\\cdot 2}$ indicates the duality in taste of movies  1,2 and 3,4 by the sign (-0.4 vs. 0.6). Likewise, we recognize the difference between users in the matrix $U$. There are three user patterns: $(0.4, -0.4)$, $(0.3,0.5)$ and $(0.6,0.1)$.  \n",
