    "Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a vast, rugged mountain landscape. Your goal is to reach the lowest point in this terrainâ€”a hidden valley where the air is still. Easy, you might think. I'll just look at the map and see where the lowest point is. But what if the map is infinitely big? And what if the mountain landscape is in a high-dimensional hyperspace, where you can't see anything but three dimensional projections of this hyperspace? The optimization challenges in machine learning are a bit like that: the task to find the lowest valley an infinitely large space extending within hundreds of dimensions. What we need to solve this task is to get some hints where to look for the valley, and this is what optimization theory can deliver.\n",
