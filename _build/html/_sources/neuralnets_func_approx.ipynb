    "What do we mean exactly by a _complex task_? ANNs build high-dimensional complex functions using simple modules -- artificial neurons. However, like the brain, ANNs are black boxes and are hard to interpret, i.e. to clearly understand how they get their final output. Nevertheless, ANNs are universal approximators, they can approximate any function as indicated in the following theorem shown by Pinkus {cite}`pinkus1999approximation`.\n",

    "Modern activation functions are unbounded such that their output values do not saturate and their derivatives do not collapse to zero for larger activation values (see {numref}`sigmoid_function` and {numref}`relu_function`). This is paramount in deep neural networks, since the activation values might become bigger and bigger as the feed input features $ \\lbrace x_{i} \\rbrace $ are forwarded over the network. Moreover, unbounded activation functions -- with non-zero derivatives -- are crucial for the deep learning itself. As we will see shortly (in the backpropagation procedure), the network weights are updated in order to minimize some loss function $ L(y,\\hat{y}) $. Specifically, each weight is updated using the back propagated derivatives of the loss function in respect to the weight itself. To accomplish this, the chain rule of calculus is applied several times over potentially long branches of the associated computational graph linking the parameter to the network outputs. Additionally, the product of chained derivatives might become smaller and smaller as derivatives are back propagated through the network. Note though that, when the activation function saturates, its derivative becomes close to zero. Thus, if that happens in all paths between a network parameter and the network outputs, this parameter will become insensitive to the improvements in the loss function and will not be updated anymore, i.e. the network will not learn to perform its task based on this parameter.\n",
